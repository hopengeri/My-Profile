                <p>I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted. Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.</p>
                <p>Contrary to this saying, we cannot choose our family as we choose our friends. But I can say that I’m blessed with a wonderful family. My family is very small with five members – my father, my mother, my brother, my sister and me. My family is a middle class family and my father is officially the bread winner of our family. My mother supports him financially by taking tuitions for school children.</p>
                <p>We do not have much money or wealth but what my family has in abundance is love for each other which cannot be replaced by anything else in this world. My father and my mother are the role models to my siblings and I. They struggle a lot to give us a better life. More than anything they have taught us discipline and morals of life which is helping us to lead our lives in a righteous path even today.</p>

            <p>I remember when I always wanted to go to school. I always felt bored at home since my parents went to work. When it was time to go to school I was so excited. I had always wanted to were uniform so i asked my mum where mine was. Since I was being taken to a school that didn't were uniform my mum told me that I did not need any uniform. I was a bit sad but hey, I was going to school!</p>
            <p>I went to Green Acorn Academy in Kindergaten. When I was in Pre-unit(I don't know if they still call it that) there was a graduation. I was so excited to go to Standard One. I later moved to Garden Eastate Academy. I really loved that school. I studied there till I was in Standard four. For my upper-primary I went to Ruaraka Academy. I still study their and I am currently in Standard 7. Next year I am going to sit for my KCPE exam. I know that I am going to excel and make my parents proud!</p>
